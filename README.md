Building off my 3d6 roller and using it to create characters for Hackmaster by Kenzerco

This will start off with a base program from my 3d6roller but will start to implement functions to calculate out modifications.  in the end the plan is to have it be able to save characters to a MySQL database.  Eventually be able to update characters from the save files.
